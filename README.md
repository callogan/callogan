## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ruslan

Initially I have acquired all Python-connected knowledge and skills for web development.
After some consideration I have found it reasonable to proceed my IT journey specifically in Data Science venue.
Now I am making energetic steps to master out all the necessary DS tools, putting huge accent on Mathematics,
Statistics and deep undestanding of DS-related Python libraries.

Hope to succeed in this field effortlessly.
